## Technical Dependencies Map
- Basic movement needed before platform interactions
- Light system required before shadow implementation
- Color system needed before filter effects
- Basic platforms required before complex interactions
- Core mechanics needed before puzzle design
- Testing required after each major feature

## Testing Milestones
Each phase requires:
1. Core functionality testing
2. Performance evaluation
3. Player feedback collection
4. Bug documentation
5. Mechanics validation
